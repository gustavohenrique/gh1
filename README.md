> URL Shortener written in Golang

It's is my first personal web app written in Go. I have studied Go for 2 weeks and I learned so much about it.
In this first version I learned about:

* Database operations
* API using net/http and Gorilla Mux
* TDD and BDD in Go
* Godeps
* And much more

If you have tips or advices to improve my code please, share with me.
